Notes:
    
(1) Theoretically, to round an amount to the nearest cent, use round(amount*100)/100.
    However, iOS sometimes rounds the remainder .##4999... down (e.g., 2.454999... to 2.45).
    So, test the remainder: (let amount be "a")
    
    	if (a*100 - floor(a*100) > 0.499999) && (a*100 - floor(a*100) < 0.5)
    		{ a = round(a*100 + 1)/100 }
    	else { a = round(a*100)/100 }
    
    Using 2.454999... as an example:
    
    	2.454999...*100 = 245.4999...
        floor(245.4999...) = 245
        So, 245.4999... - 245 = 0.4999...
        Meaning, 0.4999... > 0.499999 && 0.4999... < 0.5 are true
    
        Therefore, a = round(245.4999... + 1)/100
        = round(246.4999...)/100
        = 256/100 = 2.56
    
(2) If one casts a Double as an Integer, iOS will simply truncate the decimal part of a number.
    For example, Int(38.999...) = 38, even though 38.999... = 39. So, test the remainder:
    
        if (a - floor(a) > 0.99999)
    		{ a = Int(a + 1) }
        else { a = Int(a) }
    
    Using 38.999... as an example:
    
        floor(38.999...) = 38
        So, 38.999... - 38 = 0.999...
        Meaning, 0.999... > 0.99999 is true
    
        Therefore, a = Int(38.999... + 1)
        = Int(39.999...) = 39

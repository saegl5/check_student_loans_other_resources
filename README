[Notes]

``Video'' directory contains more information on introduction.mov and instructions on how to export a new introduction.mov, as well.
Utilizing a separate CHANGELOG for the ``Video'' directory because the video itself is drawn from a project.
``Images'' directory also contains an ``svg'' directory of SVG files from which the images were exported.

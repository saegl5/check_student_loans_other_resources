``Panel Discussion.pdf'' and ``Final Copy.docx'' consist of an introductory script, app overview and course material.
``Panel Discussion.pdf'' also begins with a script for inviting experts to participate in the study and ends with a feedback form template.

Instructional App = course material + iOS app

How to Replicate the Panel Discussion
-------------------------------------

Invite experts to participate in the study.
When one meets with the participants, follow the introductory script. Keep the app overview for personal reference.
Course material is distributed to experts for them to complete. However, do not simply hand them the material; illustrate some examples briefly.
Once experts are done, ask them to provide feedback.

How to Utilize the Final Copy
-----------------------------

Instructors follow the introductory script and can keep the app overview for their personal reference.
Course material is distributed to students for them to complete. However, instructors should not simply hand them the material; they should illustrate some examples briefly.
On how to proceed from there is the instructor's discretion.

[Notes]

Images of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, 16.10 and 17.04 may also work.
Images of newer Ubuntu versions (i.e., 18.04 LTS onward), though, may not work.
Videos were recorded in Open Broadcaster Software, hence the ``obs'' directory in /usr/local/introduction.
Make sure that imported files are located in the project directory; they are not copied or moved into the directory automatically.

Issue #1: virtual disk was split into multiple files...was meant to be stored as a single file
Trialed VMware Workstation 15 Pro
$ vmware-vdiskmanager -r "Ubuntu 17.10.vmdk" -t 0 Ubuntu-17.10.vmdk
Removed the old multiple files, and renamed the single file "Ubuntu 17.10.vmdk"

Compressed "Ubuntu 17.10.vmdk" and "Ubuntu 17.10.vmx"

Issue #2: maximum upload filesize is 10 MiB (i.e., about 10.4 MB), so the single file had to be split into parts
$ split -b 10m "Ubuntu 17.10.zip" "Ubuntu 17.10.zip.part-" -d
(parts are numbered 00-89 and 9000-9213)

Issue #3: files can only uploaded one at a time, so 
10-20
